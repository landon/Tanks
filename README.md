Tanks
=====

C# port of a Pascal port of the Intellivision game Battle Tanks (part of Triple Action from 1981)

i ported this to Pascal long ago to run on a 286 in mode 13h.  
my brother drew the graphics, still in their original VGA format.
This is copy/pasted from Pascal and made to work in C# (with all the original coding idiosyncrasies intact).
